While Wysc is open source, our intentions are for users to use our assets to inspire your own creations. Any work created using the resources here that may cause confusion for users between your product and Wysc's, and does not properly attribute, will be considered a breach of copyright.

### Contributions to Wysc:

All users are welcome to contribute any code revisions they deem appropriate through a pull request. Wysc Staff will review the pull requests and, if approved, will also qualify your username to be listed [on our Credits page](https://gitnisyl.github.io/wysc/docs/about/credits).

 

### Credits:

We do not believe in theft of other works. Using our open source code to contribute to your own works is okay, but wholesale theft for personal profit crosses a line at Wysc. As a result, we'd like to be friendly patrons of the open source community as well and \(attempt to\) list all resources we have come to rely on [in our credits page](https://gitnisyl.github.io/wysc/docs/about/credits). Are we missing something? [Let us know and we'll be glad to add you on our list!](https://gitnisyl.github.io/wysc/docs/about/contact#official-inquiries)
