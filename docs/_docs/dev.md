### Promoting Wysc

If you're a Seed or Sprout, you can help by sharing Wysc with your friends! Knowing that we can be helpful not only to you, but also your friends, is a grand honor.

See more info by typing `,bump` in `#bots-spam`

Our social media accounts are not maintained right now. If you're in Contributor Hub, let us know if you'd like to help run them!


### Contributor Hub

The most popular way for those Sapling rank and above to help contribute to Wysc is by suggesting feature updates, bug fixes, and commenting on new features before they release to the public!

Some contributors may be invited to become a Pond and contribute to behind-the-scenes administrative Wysc decisions.

To join Contributor Hub, you need to be at least Sapling rank. `#ch-info` will then appear, which lets you join!


### Developers

If you know how GitHub and Jekyll work, feel free to directly help by making pull requests!
{:.mb-2}
- Click the GitHub icon on any page to get started
- The working GitHub branch is `dev`

Here are some things we're always looking for help on:
{:.mb-2}
- Fixing typos
- Adding/updating our Credits page ([List of Credits here](https://github.com/coffeebank/wysc/blob/dev/docs/_data/credits.yml){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"})
- Adding/updating Bot Commands pages

For bigger contributions, we recommend you [contact us](/docs/contact) first, either in Contributor Hub or `#support`. GitHub Issues are monitored, but may have a delayed response.

Our site's a bit barebones at the moment, but we do have some APIs if you ever feel like playing with them:

[See APIs](/docs/dev/api){: .jtbutton}


### Credits

Contributions are generally governed by our [default Partner License](/docs/licenses/partners), which allows us to use your contributions productively while still allowing you to retain ownership rights over your contributions. Special partner licenses may be arranged on a case-by-case basis.

All contributions on GitHub are attributed by your GitHub user.

We are working on a way to incorporate user contributions into the Credits page, and will update this page when we have more updates.
