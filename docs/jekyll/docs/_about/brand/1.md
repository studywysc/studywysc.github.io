### Wysc Branding and Logo

The Wysc Logo is a custom-remixed design that should only be used in square, rounded corners, and circle formats.

### Wysc Design Use

Wysc's server design, channel/category organization, and unique channel features are **open for others to replicate, as long as there is substantial remixing of features.**

We are always happy to see other servers incorporating our ideas! For example, we have pioneered a cafe experience through channels such as #studygram, automated mixed-use content feeds, and liberal use of colored embeds. But all these features are available for the public to use as well! We encourage users to [check out our Credits page](credits) to see how we do it and create their own server using the very tools that have helped make our server possible.

However, **we do not tolerate a significantly replicated user experience** without prior arrangements. This includes (but is not limited to) copying many or all aspects of our server without a different target audience, using phrasing that is similar to our promotional material without noticeable variation, or providing an experience that may cause confusion between Wysc and your creation.

**If you would like to heavily replicate Wysc**, but for a different target audience or with a significant feature, we'd love to partner with you to provide enhanced support and integration that can benefit both you and Wysc! [Reach out to us on our Contact page](contact) or send us a message in #support to make it happen.

**If you have an idea to improve Wysc**, we are recruiting! [See our Staff Recruitment page for more details.](staffrecruit)
